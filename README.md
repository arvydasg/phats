# Phats

Wise exports an excel document, this excel document gets cleaned up and properly formatted so it can then be exported to a .txt file that can later be used with PHATS software.

.xlsx to .txt

openpyxl, pandas, tkinter, os

Make an executable later as so - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZX5kH72Yx4&t

## Things to consider
- proper name for this thing
- names of the folders
- location of the folders
- desktop shortcut
- all trash inside one trash file(otherwise phats won't work. Virgis)
- all chassi files in one folder, easy to reach
- output files in one place
- all output files must be in one dir, which is shared and read by phats tablet(domain?)
